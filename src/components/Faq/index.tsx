                    No! You can use UpStamps right away without a credit card.
                    We offer a Sandbox mode to test the features and integrate
                    them into your project. When you're comfortable, upgrade to
                    a paid plan.

                    We use Paddle to process your payment. It's the same payment
                    provider used in products such as Framer, Tower, MacPaw and
                    TablePlus. All payments are made via credit card, we do not
                    handle your credit card information directly.

                    You can switch to a new plan at any time by going to the
                    Billing page in your account. Select the plan youâ€™d like to
                    switch to and immediately start using new features.
